## 🔑 Key React Concepts to Explain in Interviews

### **1. Custom Hooks**
```jsx
const useAuth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  // Logic here
  return { user, login, logout };
};
```

### **2. Protected Routes**
```jsx
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Dashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### **3. Axios Interceptor**
```jsx
api.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return config;
});
```

### **4. Context API**
```jsx
<AuthProvider>
  <App />
</AuthProvider>
```

## 🎯 Interview Questions You'll Ace

**Q: Why React and not Next.js?**
✅ "React is the foundation. Most fresher jobs require React specifically. Next.js is great for production, but I wanted to master React fundamentals first."

**Q: How did you manage state?**
✅ "I used Context API for authentication and global state. It's built into React and perfect for this app's complexity. For larger apps, I'd consider Redux Toolkit."

**Q: Explain your authentication flow**
✅ "User logs in → Backend returns JWT → Store in localStorage → Axios interceptor adds token to every request → Protected routes check token validity"

**Q: How did you optimize performance?**
✅ "React.lazy() for code splitting, useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback to prevent re-renders, and debounced search inputs"
