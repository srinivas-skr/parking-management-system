## 🚀 Tech Stack (Fresher-Optimized)

### **Why React 18 (Not Next.js)?**
- ✅ **90% of fresher jobs** ask for "React" specifically
- ✅ **Interview focus** on React fundamentals
- ✅ **Easier to explain** in interviews
- ✅ **Resume clarity** - shows React mastery first

### **Core Technologies**
```
React 18           → Frontend framework (MUST for jobs)
Vite               → Fast build tool
React Router v6    → Navigation & protected routes
Tailwind CSS       → Rapid UI development
Axios              → API calls with JWT interceptors
Context API        → State management (React fundamentals)
React Hook Form    → Form handling
Framer Motion      → Smooth animations
Lucide React       → Modern icons
react-qr-code      → QR code generation
```

## 🎓 Interview Readiness

### **Key React Concepts You'll Explain:**

#### 1. **Custom Hooks**
```jsx
// useAuth.js
const useAuth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  const login = async (credentials) => {
    const data = await authService.login(credentials);
    setUser(data.user);
    localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
  };
  
  return { user, loading, login, logout };
};
```

#### 2. **Protected Routes**
```jsx
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children }) => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  return user ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
};
```

#### 3. **Axios Interceptors**
```jsx
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

#### 4. **Context API**
```jsx
const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### **Common Interview Questions:**

**Q: Why React instead of Next.js?**
> "React is the foundation that 90% of fresher jobs require. I wanted to master React fundamentals first before moving to frameworks like Next.js. This shows I understand the core concepts that Next.js is built upon."

**Q: How did you handle authentication?**
> "I implemented JWT-based authentication. After successful login, the token is stored in localStorage and automatically attached to every API request via Axios interceptors. I created a ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication status before rendering protected pages."

**Q: Explain your state management approach**
> "I used React Context API for global state like authentication because it's built into React and perfect for this app's complexity. It demonstrates understanding of React's core state management without over-engineering with external libraries."

**Q: How did you optimize performance?**
> "I used React.lazy() for code splitting routes, useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders, image lazy loading, and debounced search inputs to reduce API calls."
