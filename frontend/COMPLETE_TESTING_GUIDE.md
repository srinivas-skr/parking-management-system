## üéì TECHNICAL QUESTIONS TO PREPARE

### For Java Developers:
**Q: "How did you handle authentication?"**
A: "I used Spring Security with JWT tokens. User credentials are validated, a token is generated with user details and role, and sent to frontend. All subsequent requests include this token in Authorization header."

**Q: "What's your database design?"**
A: "I have 4 main entities: Users, Vehicles, ParkingSlots, and Bookings. They're connected with proper foreign keys. I used JPA/Hibernate for ORM, and the schema auto-creates on startup."

**Q: "How do you prevent double bookings?"**
A: "I use optimistic locking with @Version annotation on ParkingSlot entity. When a slot is booked, the version is checked. If another transaction modified it, the booking fails and user gets an error."

### For Frontend Developers:
**Q: "Why did you choose these animations?"**
A: "I used Framer Motion because it's performant (60fps), declarative, and provides smooth transitions. All animations are GPU-accelerated using transform and opacity properties."

**Q: "How is your app responsive?"**
A: "I used Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach. Breakpoints at 768px (md) and 1024px (lg). Tested on various devices. Particles adapt count based on screen size."

**Q: "How do you handle API errors?"**
A: "I have axios interceptors that catch errors globally. For 401, I redirect to login. For network errors (backend sleeping), I implemented retry logic with user-friendly messages."

**"Can you show the code?"**
‚Üí Open VS Code, show clean file structure, explain component architecture.

**"Is this production-ready?"**
‚Üí "The architecture is production-ready. For production, I'd add: monitoring, logging, rate limiting, payment gateway, email notifications."

**"What would you improve?"**
‚Üí "I'd add: real-time WebSocket notifications, advanced analytics, mobile app, payment integration, admin dashboard with more controls."

## üìû Emergency Support

If something breaks during demo:
1. **Stay calm** - Say "Let me check the logs"
2. **Open console** (F12) - Show you can debug
3. **Check backend terminal** - Mention error handling
4. **Have screenshots ready** - "Here's how it usually looks"
5. **Fallback to Swagger** - Show APIs work even if UI has issues

Remember: Even bugs can be learning moments to show your debugging skills!
