# 🔧 DEMO LOGIN FIX - RESOLVED!

## ❌ PROBLEM

**Error:** "Demo login failed. Please try manual login."

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

Your `.env` file was configured to use the **Render.com backend**:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
```

But that backend was **sleeping** (takes 30-60s to wake up), so demo login failed!

## ✅ SOLUTION

**Changed `.env` to use local backend:**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## 🚀 HOW TO FIX NOW

### **Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

Or:
```
Press: Ctrl + F5
```

### **Step 2: Try Demo Login Again**
```
1. Click "Try Demo Now"
2. Should work instantly! ✅
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION

Backend is running correctly:
- ✅ Port 8080 is active
- ✅ Demo user created: demo@parking.com / demo123
- ✅ API test successful (returned JWT token)

Frontend will now connect to local backend:
- ✅ No 30-60s delay
- ✅ Instant response
- ✅ Demo login will work

## 🔄 IF STILL NOT WORKING

### **Option 1: Restart Dev Server**
```powershell
# Find the terminal running "npm run dev"
# Press: Ctrl + C
# Run: npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
```
1. Press: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Check: Cached images and files
3. Click: Clear data
4. Refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **Option 3: Check Console**
```
1. Press: F12 (open DevTools)
2. Go to: Console tab
3. Look for: "🔗 API Base URL: ..."
4. Should say: http://localhost:8080/api
```

## 📝 FOR PRODUCTION

When deploying to production, switch back to Render URL:

```env
# Production (Render)
VITE_API_URL=https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api

# Development (Local)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## ✅ QUICK FIX SUMMARY

**Problem:** Frontend → Render (sleeping) ❌
**Solution:** Frontend → Localhost (awake) ✅

**Action:** Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**NOW TRY DEMO LOGIN AGAIN! Should work instantly! 🚀**
