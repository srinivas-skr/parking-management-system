## Emergency Troubleshooting

### If slots don't load:
1. Check backend terminal: "Tomcat started on port 8080"
2. Open browser console (F12): Check for API errors
3. Solution: Refresh backend with START_SERVER.bat

### If animations are choppy:
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Refresh page (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Mention: "Optimized for 60fps, might need GPU acceleration"

### If login fails:
1. Double-check credentials: user/user123
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Try admin/admin123 as backup

## üé¨ 30-Second Elevator Pitch

*"This is a full-stack parking management system I built using React and Spring Boot. Notice the smooth 60fps animations powered by Framer Motion - the floating particles, the card hover effects, and the data visualization charts. It features JWT authentication, real-time slot booking, and a responsive design. The backend uses Spring Security with role-based access control. It's a complete solution that demonstrates both technical skills and attention to user experience."*
