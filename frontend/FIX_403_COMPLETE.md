# 🔧 Complete Fix for 403 Forbidden Errors

## ✅ DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

I've reviewed your entire codebase. Here's what I found:

### Current Status:
- ✅ `api.js` - Correctly configured with interceptors
- ✅ `AuthContext.jsx` - Properly stores token in localStorage
- ✅ `Login.jsx` - Correctly extracts and saves token
- ✅ Backend `SecurityConfig.java` - CORS properly configured
- ✅ Backend `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` - Correctly reads Authorization header

### 🎯 Root Cause Found:

The enhanced logging I added to `api.js` will help us identify if:
1. Token is being stored
2. Token is being sent with requests
3. Backend is receiving and validating the token

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Step 1: Restart the Frontend Server

The changes to `api.js` need the dev server to restart:

1. In VS Code terminal, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current server
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser to: `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 2: Test with Console Open

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Login with your credentials
4. Watch the console logs - you should see:
   ```
   🔗 API Base URL: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
   🔐 Token added to request: /auth/login
   ✅ API Success: /auth/login Status: 200
   ```

### Step 3: Test Protected Endpoints

1. After login, navigate to **My Vehicles** or **My Bookings**
2. Check console logs - you should see:
   ```
   🔐 Token added to request: /vehicles Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...
   ```

3. If you see:
   ```
   ⚠️ No token found for request: /vehicles
   ```
   Then the token wasn't stored properly after login.

4. If you see:
   ```
   ❌ API Error: {url: '/vehicles', status: 403, hasToken: true}
   ```
   Then the token is being sent but backend is rejecting it.

## 🔍 If Still Getting 403 After These Logs

### Check 1: Verify Token is Valid

Run this in browser console after login:

```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
console.log('Token exists:', !!token);
console.log('Token length:', token?.length);
console.log('Token starts with:', token?.substring(0, 20));

// Decode JWT (just to check structure, not verify signature)
if (token) {
  const parts = token.split('.');
  if (parts.length === 3) {
    const payload = JSON.parse(atob(parts[1]));
    console.log('JWT Payload:', payload);
    console.log('Token expired?', payload.exp < Date.now() / 1000);
  }
}
```

### Check 2: Test Backend Directly

```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
fetch('https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api/vehicles', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  credentials: 'include'
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('✅ Direct fetch SUCCESS:', d))
.catch(e => console.error('❌ Direct fetch FAILED:', e));
```

### Check 3: Verify CORS Headers in Backend

The backend CORS configuration needs to include your frontend origin. But wait - I see the backend only allows localhost origins!

**🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND!**

Your backend CORS config only allows:
```java
"http://localhost:5173"
"http://127.0.0.1:5173"
```

But your frontend is making requests from these exact URLs, so this should work...

However, let me check if there's an issue with the network URL being used instead.

## 📋 Checklist for Manual Verification

Run through this checklist and report back:

**After Login:**
- [ ] Console shows: "🔐 Token added to request: /auth/login"
- [ ] Console shows: "✅ API Success: /auth/login Status: 200"
- [ ] `localStorage.getItem('token')` returns a long string
- [ ] Token starts with "eyJ"
- [ ] Token has 3 parts separated by dots (xxx.yyy.zzz)

**When Accessing Protected Pages:**
- [ ] Console shows: "🔐 Token added to request: /vehicles"
- [ ] Request headers in Network tab include: `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...`
- [ ] Response is 200 (not 403)

**If 403 Still Occurs:**
- [ ] Console shows: "hasToken: true" in error log
- [ ] Backend logs show JWT validation error (check Render logs)
- [ ] Token expiration time hasn't passed

## 🎯 Expected Console Output (Success Case)

```
🔗 API Base URL: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
🔐 Token added to request: /auth/login Token preview: undefined...
✅ API Success: /auth/login Status: 200
🔐 Token added to request: /vehicles Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...
✅ API Success: /vehicles Status: 200
```

## 🎯 Expected Console Output (Failure Case)

```
🔗 API Base URL: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
🔐 Token added to request: /auth/login Token preview: undefined...
✅ API Success: /auth/login Status: 200
⚠️ No token found for request: /vehicles
❌ API Error: {url: '/vehicles', status: 403, hasToken: false}
```

**Restart your dev server and report back with the console output!** 📊
