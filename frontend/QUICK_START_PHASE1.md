## 💡 Pro Tips

### Animation Best Practices:
✅ Always set `duration` (0.2-0.5s ideal)  
✅ Use `ease` functions for smooth motion  
✅ Limit simultaneous animations  
✅ Test on slower devices  

### Performance:
✅ Use `will-change` for animated elements  
✅ Avoid animating `width/height`  
✅ Prefer `transform` and `opacity`  
✅ Use `React.memo` for heavy components  

### Accessibility:
✅ Ensure keyboard navigation works  
✅ Add `aria-labels` where needed  
✅ Support reduced motion preference  
✅ Maintain color contrast
