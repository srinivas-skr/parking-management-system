## 🔗 Your Live URLs

### API Endpoints:
```
Base URL: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
Health: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/actuator/health
Swagger: https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/swagger-ui.html
```

# Should return: {"status":"UP"}
```

## ⚠️ Render Free Tier Behavior

### Sleep After Inactivity:
- **Spins down:** After 15 minutes of no requests
- **Wake up time:** 30-60 seconds on first request
- **Your frontend handles this:** Shows "Backend waking up..." message

### How It Works:
1. User opens your app
2. Frontend tries to fetch data
3. If backend sleeping → Shows retry message
4. Backend wakes up (30-60 seconds)
5. Data loads automatically
6. Everything works normally

---

## 📱 Frontend Configuration

### Current .env File:
```env
VITE_DEV_PORT=5173
VITE_API_URL=https://parking-management-system-hs2i.onrender.com/api
```

✅ **This is correct!** Your frontend is already pointing to Render.

---

## 🎯 How to Test Everything

### 1. Start Frontend:
```bash
cd c:\Users\vikas\Documents\Java_fresher\parking-management2
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What You Have

### Backend (Render):

### H2 In-Memory:
```properties
Type: In-memory (embedded)
URL: jdbc:h2:mem:parking_db
